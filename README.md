### Hello! Welcome to my Github page

Here you can find a few projects I've worked on over the years.

A few are from my undergraduate studies at UC Davis:
* riemannellpsoids contains code for a summer research project with Clare Zheng, advised by Dr. Joseph Biello. We studied the dynamics of rotating fluid ellipsoids, a *really* idealized model of planets like Earth.
* GotMalware contains code from a collaborative group project as part of the CyberDefenders internship. My group built an ML model to detect malware in Android apps - a proof-of-concept that was then expanded by a Malware company we partnered with. We won the internship's "Best Project" award for this work!
* Mat 124 was for a Mathematical Biology capstone course. My teammates and I built a system of differential equations to explain HPV spread in populations.
* Mat119bchaos project was a project for the Ordinary Differential Equations class. We made a simple idealized cryptographic scheme for encoding and decoding messages, harnessing the power of chaos in dynamical systems.

I also keep code for my PhD research projects on Github, but I don't usually make it public until the papers have gone through review. If you've seen me talk about my work somewhere and are interested, feel free to reach out to me at my firstinitial.lastname at gmail.com - I'm happy to share code if it would be useful to you!

Caltech PhD research projects: 
* Stickiness in CMIP6: I'm investigating how temperature and humidity change during extreme humid heat events under global warming using a cool metric called "stickiness"
* Humid heat downscaling: I'm testing how choice of bias correction and downscaling method impacts humid heat projections in CMIP6 models  
* CMIP6 water storage: I developed a method to evaluate terrestrial water storage (soil moisture, groundwater, etc) in CMIP6 models using GRACE observations and seasonal EOF analysis.
* Hadley cell shifts: I developed a framework for understanding shifts of the Hadley circulation (i.e., changes in the width of the tropics) over a range of timescales (seasonal, interannual, and global warming related) using the energy balance.
